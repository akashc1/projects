##### [Autocomplete](https://github.com/akashc1/projects/tree/master/swe-practice/autocomplete)
A straightforward program in C that completes an input word. Uses a space-delmited text file with words and their respective weights (number of occurences in books in the [Project Gutenberg library](https://www.gutenberg.org/)), and recommends a completed word based on this weight. 

##### [Autocorrect](https://github.com/akashc1/projects/tree/master/swe-practice/autocorrect)
C++ program that corrects a given input. Uses a space-delmited text file with words with their respective weights. It calculates various edits of the input word (insertions, deletions, substitutions, transpositions) to find real words and makes a recommendation based on weight.

##### [Bitpacking](https://github.com/akashc1/projects/tree/master/bitpacking)
A C program that uses bitpacking to store information on patients and their disease conditions for 5 diseases. Quite rudimentary but used to learn binary options in C. Can defintely be expanded for other applications.

##### [Chess](https://github.com/akashc1/projects/tree/master/swe-practice/chess-cpp)
A large C++ project to implement a game of chess from the command line. I've impemented a couple versions on top of the classic chess implementation, including Spooky Chess, in which there is a ghost piece with random movement that captures pieces in spaces it lands on (except the King!), and King fo the Hill, in which getting your King to the middle 4 spots on the board is a victory. Beware of bugs!

##### [Image Processing](https://github.com/akashc1/projects/tree/master/swe-practice/image-processing)
A project in C that uses [PPM images](https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~yfeaste/cpsc101/CPSC101F15Yvon/Lectures/Oct1-ppm/PPM_Images.pdf) for various image processing techniques, including swapping color channels, changing brightness, cropping, converting to grayscale, changing contrast, [Gaussian blur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur), sharpening, and edge detection. Can also write the images to a PPM file.

##### [*k*-means Clustering](https://github.com/akashc1/projects/tree/master/swe-practice/kmeans-clustering)
A project in C++ that performs [*k*-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) on a dataset from a file (space-delimited, of course). User inputs the number of clusters to use, and the program prints to a file the data points and the cluster number it belongs to.
