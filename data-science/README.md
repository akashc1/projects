# Data Science
This is a collection of data science projects I've worked on. They were all done in Jupyter Notebooks, which might look weird on Github. Some of the markdown doesn't compile well but it should all be fine if downloaded and run in an actual jupyter notebook.

### AP Class
Classifying [myocardial action potentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_action_potential) ([ventricular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_action_potential), [atrial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_action_potential)). I used different features, including hand-crafted features (average action potential, APDx), [fourier coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series#Definition), and [principal components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis).

### MRI
Using a sequence of [MRI images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging) to experiment with various techniques. I start out with denoising using a simple 2-D [Gaussian filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_filter), trying to find the best value of $\sigma$ for this purpose. Then I do edge detection in two steps (separating dimensions) with a filter that's a [DoG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_of_Gaussians) in one direction while a regular Gaussian filter in the other. Then I normalize the image, threshold and use non-maximum suppression before combining the two resulting images. I then converted the images into the Fourier and PCA basis, and calculated the error in reconstruction with each basis. Then we kick it up a notch and jump to linear regression, using previous image frames to predict the next frame. Finally, I did temporal segmentation (trying to detect from the features when the heart in the image is in contraction vs. relaxation using one of the features.

### ECG
Given an [ECG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography) signal, using normalization, thresholding, and non-max suppression to implement a peak detector which detects peaks (ie. heart beats) in the signal. From there, calculating the [R-R interval](https://help.elitehrv.com/article/67-what-are-r-r-intervals) and heart rate. Then, given a noisy ECG signal, I used the [Pan-Tompkins Algorithm](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~gari/teaching/cdt/A3/readings/ECG/Pan+Tompkins.pdf) for QRS detection. Finally, I use a video of a finger on a phone camera to simulate an ECG, and take the magnitude of frames as the new signal, and use the same techniques to get a heart rate.
