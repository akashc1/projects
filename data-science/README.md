# Data Science
This is a collection of data science projects I've worked on. They were all done in Jupyter Notebooks, which might look weird on Github. Some of the markdown doesn't compile well but it should all be fine if downloaded and run in the proper environment.

### AP Class
Classifying [myocardial action potentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiac_action_potential) ([ventricular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_action_potential), [atrial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrial_action_potential)). I used different features, including hand-crafted features (average action potential, APDx), [fourier coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series#Definition), and [principal components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis).
