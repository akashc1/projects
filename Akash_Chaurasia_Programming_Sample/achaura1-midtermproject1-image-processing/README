COMPILING THE PROGRAM
Since a Makefile is included, simply type 'make' to compile the program.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM
A 'main' executable file is created after compilation. Type './main' to run the program

The Makefile also includes a -g tag, so valgrind can be run on this program by typing 'valgrind --leak-check=full ./main'


DESIGN CHOICES AND CHALLENGES
Choices:
- We modularized our code so that our main has as little code as possible. This helped us locate errors later on.
- We coded this assignment one function at a time and tested it incrementally (unit testing). This also helped localize errors.
- We chose to return a pixel array instead of an image for the blur and sharpen functions, which helped with memory allocation issues.

Challenges:
- Gaussian blur was quite challenging; it took a fair amount of time for us to logic out how to do it.
- Figuring out whether something was in bounds for blur was very difficult. We ended up making a whole other method just for that.
- Keeping track of alloc'd memory was quite tedious, and took a while to debug.
-Figuring out how to change the image (for example the data array) without forgetting to free allocated heap memory
