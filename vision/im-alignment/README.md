### Image Alignment, RANSAC Feature Matching, and Stitching



This part came from my interest in image transformations and feature extraction. I implemented a Harris corner detector, a RANSAC algorithm to match corners from 2 images, and a least-squares method to solve for a transformation to align two given images. There's also a simple method of stitching the aligned images together.
