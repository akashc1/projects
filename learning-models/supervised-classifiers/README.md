## Supervised Classifiers - Perceptron, Logistic Regression

These are some of the simplest models in machine learning, and my real intro to implementing any model beyond a perceptron.

### Part 1: [Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron)

This is a straightforward perceptron with the learning rule based on gradient descent. 

### Part 2: [Logistic Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression)

This part was a cool extension of perceptron since it has an additional layer of complexity with the logistic function. This also introduces the [softmax function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function) to create a valid probability distribution, which make things a little bit harder.
