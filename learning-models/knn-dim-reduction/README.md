# k-Nearest Neighbor & Dimensionality Reduction

I wanted to experiment with graphical models and Markov Random Fields (MRF) seemed very interesting. I found a [paper describing EM for segmentation](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00072132/document) as well as the Potts model. This model is used more for statistical mechanics but seemed useful for segmentation as well.
