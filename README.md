## Akash Chaurasia
### akashc@stanford.edu
A collection of projects I have worked on or am currently working on. I mostly work in Python and C++, with experience in C, Java, and MATLAB. My preferred languages are Python and C++.

I am an undergraduate student at [Stanford University](https://www.jhu.edu/) studying Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science. I am interested in medical technology, specifically the application of machine learning amethods in healthcare. 

##### [Data Science](https://github.com/akashc1/projects/tree/master/data-science)
Applying data science methods in Python on human biomedical data including ECG waveforms, MRI images, and action potential waveforms. Includes some machine learning techniques and frameworks such as [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and others, with more to come!

##### [Learning Models](https://github.com/akashc1/projects/tree/master/learning-models)
A large set of machine learning models I have implemented, from a simple multiclass perceptron to Expectation Maximization on graphical models. This covers some vision (segmentation), a good amount of natural language processing, and various other types of models.

##### [Vision](https://github.com/akashc1/projects/tree/master/vision)
Some vision tasks I have taken on. Most of it is lower level stuff I implemented to get an understanding of how stuff works. Most of these things are probably in OpenCV. There is some deep learning exploration in there.

##### [Software Engineering](https://github.com/akashc1/projects/tree/master/swe-practice)
A variety of general programming tasks I've done to get better. Mostly in C/C++, they vary from binary operations to an autocorrect algorithm, image processing in C, and k-means clustering.
